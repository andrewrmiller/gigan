# Gigan - Desktop Jira Client

A Flutter desktop project.

## Motivation

Jira's web UI has a number of issues.  Using it daily can be painful.

- Create new issue form has different capabilities than edit existing issue form
- When converting an issue from one type to another you are often left at a random location
- Can't easily change owner and status in all list views
- Web app can be slow at times
- etc.
